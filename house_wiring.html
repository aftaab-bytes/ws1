		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>House wiring in an engineering workshop involves the electrical installation process necessary to supply power to various devices and appliances within a building. This essential system ensures safe distribution of electricity from the main power supply to outlets, switches, and fixtures throughout the workshop.

			The process begins with a detailed electrical plan that outlines the placement of outlets, switches, and lighting fixtures based on the workshop's layout and operational needs. Engineers and electricians carefully calculate the electrical load requirements to determine the appropriate wire sizes, circuit breakers, and other components needed to ensure reliable and safe operation.</p>
		
		<h2>Electrical Safety</h2>
		<p>Electric current affects the body when it flows through. The basic unit of current is amp. This is the current which flows through a resistance of 1 ohm when a voltage of 1 volt is applied across it. However, current as low as thousandths of amps can have an adverse effect on the body.</p>

		<h2>Procedure</h2>
		<p>Study the given wiring diagram. Make the location points for energy meter main switch box, switchboard, and lamp. Draw the lines for wiring on the wooden board. Place the wires along with the line and fix.</p>
		<p>Fix the bulb holder, switches, socket in marked positions on the wooden board. Connect the energy meter and main switch box in marked positions on the wooden board. Give a supply to the wires circuit. Test the working of light and socket.</p>
		
		<h2>History of House Wiring</h2>
		<p>The history of house wiring dates back to the late 1800s, when Thomas Edison developed the first practical incandescent light bulb. In 1882, Edison's direct current (dc) generating station at 257 Pearl Street, New York City, began supplying electricity to customers in the First District. This installation was the forerunner of all central electric generating stations.</p>
		<p>In the early 1900s, alternating current (ac) systems became popular, and the first residential electrical wiring systems were developed. The introduction of electrical codes and standards in the mid-20th century ensured the safety and efficiency of house wiring systems.</p>
